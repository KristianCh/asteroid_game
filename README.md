# Welcome to the Asterogue repo!

Asterogue is a rogue-like game with auto-battler and deck-building elements based on the classic game Asteroids. The player builds their fleet, gets upgrades and destroys waves of incoming asteroids.

This repo contains the project files necessary to build Asterogue.
